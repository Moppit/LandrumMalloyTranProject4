CSCI 5616: Intro to VR, Final Project -- Relax VR

## Teammates
- Elly Landrum
- Christen Malloy
- Michelle Tran

## Unity Version
2020.3.24f1

## Run the Project
Go to `Menu.unity` and run using an Oculus Quest 2. You should be able to select which scene you'd like to try using the menu. You can select an option by grabbing the block corresponding to the same color as the menu item displayed in front of you. Each scene has an action to return to the main menu from there (waterfall: touching the arrow, candle: snuffing out the candle, stars: pressing the X button).
